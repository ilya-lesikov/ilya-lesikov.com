I'm an experienced **Automation Developer (DevOps/SRE)**, who loves development, but still has a strong Linux SysAdmin background.

I solve problems and make things easy (not simple). No reinventing the wheel. No overcomplicating. I know the balance between doing it right and quickly. Generally "doing it right > quickly" though. My code is clean, maintainable and extensible, autotested and documented.

I'm a good man. Easy to work with. If you care about me I care about you. Strong, balanced, informed.
