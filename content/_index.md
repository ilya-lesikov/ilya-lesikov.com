I'm a **DevOps Engineer/SRE**. I have no education and my real-world experience may be not that impressive, but I'm definitely better than you think (check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/ilya-lesikov/gke-demo)). My main strength is resilient, scalable, observable infrastructure through extensive but maintainable automation. I have more of a developer mindset, still a seasoned Linux SysAdmin.

I solve problems and make things easy (not simple). No reinventing the wheel. No overcomplicating. I know the balance between doing it right and quickly. Generally "doing it right > quickly" though. My code is clean, maintainable and extensible, autotested and documented.

I'm a good man. Easy to work with. Strong, balanced, informed.
